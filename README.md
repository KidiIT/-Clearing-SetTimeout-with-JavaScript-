 Futhermore,the following will explain and give you an indepth understanding about this project and how to use it at your various places of work.

How to use and the purpose of this project:
1. This project was intensively developed with the motive of ensuring prevention and improvement of proactive security software for the protection of an organization infrastructure.

2. Before rolling on the real deal, an indepth knowledge of html,css and Javascript is needed to be able to understand how to clear settimeout funtion with Javascript because it's kinda tricky if this is your first time here.
3. First thing first, make sure you've created or will create a nice template on your html file to be able to fit in on this project.

4. After which, link your Js.file with your html file. then use an attribute selector to make it more easier for you to get your elements to your Js.file at once. as seen on my time.js file. moreover, if you're new to programming then you've nothing to worry about because I'll stick with you throughout this project or problem solving because it's a very tricky one to work on alone. so stay tuned for more updates on what to do next.
